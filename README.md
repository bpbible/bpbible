## Features
* **Bible application**: BPBible has many of the features you would expect in a Bible application - Bible, Commentary, and Dictionary support, Bible Search, Scripture tooltips, etc.
* **Cross verse searching**: BPBible uses a proximity based search, rather than a verse-based search.  This means that a search can cross verse boundaries, giving a more natural search. It also supports regular expressions and phrases. [More info](https://github.com/bpbible/bpbible/wiki/Search).
* **Flexible layout**: BPBible lets you rearrange your layout, and will remember your layout for you.
* **Good module support**: Due to the use of the SWORD libraries, BPBible can read many different Bibles and other books.  The main module repository is hosted by [CrossWire](http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp).  More info on how to [install these books in BPBible](https://github.com/bpbible/bpbible/wiki/Installing-Books).
* **User Notes and Topic Management**: BPBible supports taking notes on a passage, as well as collecting all the passages related to a topic into a list and then organising and commenting on those passages.  [More info](https://github.com/bpbible/bpbible/wiki/User-Notes).
* **Free**: BPBible is licensed under the GPL (version 2) and is absolutely free.
* **Uses open source technology**: BPBible uses open source technology including Python, wxPython and the SWORD project.
